This standardization project aims to provide APIs to allow websites to create a floating window over the desktop.

**This is a proposed V2 iteration aimed at bringing arbitary content into the floating window.**

## Explainer

An [explainer document](v2_explainer.md) is available in the repository and describes the use cases and requirements for the v2 version of the API.

## Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
