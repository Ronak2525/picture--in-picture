* Desktop includes Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, and Windows.
* [Issue 854935](http://crbug.com/854935): Closed captions in Picture-in-Picture are not supported.
* It is possible to disable auto PiP behaviour on Android 8+ by specifing `disablePictureInPicture` content attribute on the video tag prior entering full screen.

# Microsoft Edge
Under consideration.
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/pictureinpicture/

# Safari
* [Public support](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189848#c8)

# Firefox
* Position: ["defer"](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/72) - waiting to see how the spec develops, but also looking forward to contributing to the design of the spec. Mozilla currently ships PiP without the API.
